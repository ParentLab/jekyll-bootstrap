Really, when we were deciding whether we wanted to adopt a child or not, we considered whether we were ready to parent. More than just adoption, I think that we really had to ask ourselves whether we wanted to up the ante in terms of responsibility, whether we were ready to come out of ourselves, think about somebody else. So I would compare it to somebody who is thinking about birthing a child. Are they ready to parent a child? We also thought of whether we were in a good community for adoption, was there support? And I definitely encourage all people who are considering adoption to look at their community, look at their support system, talk to their family about it, ask whether their family would be supportive to an adoptive child in the family. So there were a lot of elements but the biggest one was â€“ were we adult enough? Were we willing to really take care of somebody else more than ourselves?
