If your siblings share a room, I would highly suggest the younger child be sleeping throughout the night consistently for at least two weeks before putting them in the room with the older child. That just insures that they are not going to wake up in the middle of the night and wake your older child up. The other thing is if you do have two children that have woken up in the middle of the night, it is usually because one has woken the other one up. Let's say your younger child wakes up and wakes up your older child, make sure that you go to the younger child first because that child obviously has a problem and a reason they woke up. Always go to the one that needs you the most, first. If you do have a toddler that a child that are sharing a room and they wake up. Don't automatically run into the room. You want them to have a few minutes to self-soothe, so they can go back to sleep on their own.
