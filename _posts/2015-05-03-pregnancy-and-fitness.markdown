Pregnancy Workouts
------------------
Whether you were a couch potato or an elite athlete before your pregnancy, there are many reasons and ways to fit exercise into your routine now that you are expecting a baby.  Exercise can help fight fatigue, manage hormones, and, of course, promote long-term health for both you and baby!


Is Exercise Safe During Pregnancy?
----------------------------------
The short answer is yes! Exercise is safe during pregnancy. However, the types or amounts of exercise that is safe during pregnancies vary depending on your activity level prior to pregnancy or risk factors with your pregnancy.

“The first thing you need to do is talk to your doctor,” says personal trainer Tom Williams, “There are considerations. Your body will change. Talk to your physician and make sure they give you the thumbs up to exercise. 99 percent of the time, they will.”

After you get the thumbs up, you can return to your usual exercise routine.
