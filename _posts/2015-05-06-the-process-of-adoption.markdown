Are you ready to get started?

There are lots of different choices to be made in adoption, including which of the many types of adoption you are interested in pursuing. Broad options include domestic adoption, international adoption, and open adoption. The best way to start is to contact an agency licensed in your state to complete your adoption home study and to ask questions. Meet with multiple agencies as choosing the right agency for your family will make a big difference in your adoption journey.

Determining the eligibility to adopt is based on a process of assessment and preparation by the prospective parents, social worker, and agency. Most people are eligible to adopt, regardless of their marital status, age, income, or sexual orientation. Having a disability doesn’t automatically disqualify a prospective parent. However, for international adoption, some countries have restrictions and unique requirements for prospective families. Faith-based agencies may also have specific requirements that differ from other agencies.

Open Adoption
-------------

In open adoption, birth parents and adoptive parents share identifying information and have ongoing contact after the baby is adopted. In closed adoption, adoptive parents and birth parents share no contact information and are restricted in communicating with one another. Determining whether an open or closed adoption is best for you depends on your wants and needs as a prospective parent. Open adoptions range in nature, as well, from semi-open with limited contact after placement to fully open with frequent phone calls, emails, and visits after placement. Adoptive parents and birth parents can decide together how much openness to have based on their own comfort zones.

“When prospective adoptive parents are looking at adoption and the adoption process, a common fear that they have about having openness in particular is the role that the birth parents will play in their lives and their child's life,” says adoption expert Dr. Guylaine Hubbard Brosmer, “And what I would tell them is they are not going to agree to match with a birth mom who is an individual who they really don't like. And they also have the ability to set their profile in terms of what types of situations they are open to and ultimately, it is going to be their child that benefits from having the openness.

“Research shows that open adoption, generally, benefits children, but not in every case. Every family needs to evaluate the circumstances, get to know the birth parents,” says psychologist and Director of the Foster Care Counseling Project at Rutgers University, Dr. David Brodzinsky, “Sometimes open adoptions become more open with time, sometimes they close temporarily. The important thing to remember is, if there are bumps in the road along the way, typically, families can work them out.”
